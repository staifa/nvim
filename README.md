### Clojure neovim config written in fennel that bleeds awesomeness ###

WIP, but very much usable.

## Prerequisities ##

* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - obviously
* [patched font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - for icons
* [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - I love fugitive, but it took a lot of tweaking to get it into a shape that was actually pleasant to work with for me, so I opted for less extensibility, but better out-of-the-box experience

## Installation ##

Clone to `~/.config/`. Don't touch files in the `lua/` folder, they are autogenerated by `fnfl`. The only non-fennel file that's supposed to be modified is `init.lua`.

## LSP Config ##

For autoformatting to work, some cljfmt config must be loaded. The LSP formatter will look for it the project folder, but it's good to have a local one that's used as a default. The project config will be merged into it anyway, but if no cljfm config is loaded, the formatter doesn't start. It's good to have it alongside the `config.edn` in `~/.config/clojure-lsp/`.

There is a barebone cljfmt config in the root of this repo. To use it, add its path to the LSP config.

```edn
;; ~/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn
{:cljfmt-config-path "~/.config/nvim/.cljfmt.edn"}
```

All this and much more can be found in the [clojure-lsp docs](https://clojure-lsp.io/settings/).

## Managing language servers ##

[Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) is used as a tool of choice. To bring up th ui, execute `:Mason`. Clojure, Lua and Fennel LSs should be installed automatically.

## Snippets ##

Are currently broken because of some issues with `cmp`. Low priority currently since I almost don't use them wih Clojure.

## Key bindings ##

It's all configurable, this is how I like it. Defaults are used for everythng else and can be easily found by a help tag telescope search - `<C-h>`.

Check docs and default mappings for

* [surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* [comments](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim)
* [targetrs](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim)

if you're not familiar with them. These plugins are extremely handy.

`<leader>` is mapped to `z` and `<localleader>` to `c`. This can be changed in `init.lua`.
