# Clojure neovim config written in fennel that bleeds awesomeness

## Prerequisities

- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - obviously
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - for lazy searching
- [patched font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - for icons
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - I love fugitive, but it took a lot of tweaking to get it into a shape that was actually pleasant to work with for me, so I opted for less extensibility, but better out-of-the-box experience
- [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) - needed for parinfer-rust, there is no native imeplementation that works yet
- xclip - or similar for os clipboard support
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- fnlfmt

## Installation

Clone to `~/.config/`. Don't touch any `lua`, they are autogenerated by `nfnl`.
Run the editor from project root and wait for the plugin manager to do its stuff.

## Key bindings

Almost all bindings are documented and available in the interactive help. Start by pressing the key `z`.
